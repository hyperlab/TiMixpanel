# Mixpanel Android Module

## Description

Mixpanel module for Titanium Mobile. This module currently only exposes a subset of the full Mixpanel API.

## Usage

Add the module to you project, the latest version of the module can be found inside the dist folder. See example/app.js for usage example.

## Surveys and In-App Notifications

Since version 0.6 both surveys and in-app notifications are supported, they are however not displayed automatically. For now you need to request them manually by running the following code after opening any window:

```js
// To show any new surveys
mixpanel.showSurveyIfAvailable();

// To show any new notifications
mixpanel.showNotificationIfAvailable();
```

To make testing of surveys and in-app notifications easier, you can enable verbose logging for the Mixpanel API and  "Test Mode" (shows surveys and notifications multiple times) by adding the following lines to the Android section of your `tiapp.xml`:

```xml
<android xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
	<manifest>
		<application>
			<meta-data android:name="com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.TestMode" android:value="true" />
			<meta-data android:name="com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.EnableDebugLogging" android:value="true" />
	   </application>
	</manifest>
</android>
```

## Handling push notifications

@iamyellow's gcm.js module is a good place to integrate GCM into Titanium: https://github.com/iamyellow/gcm.js

To enable push handling in your app, read MixPanel's documentation to setup GCM correctly: https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/android#push_configure

After you have successfully integrated GCM into your app, you only have to give MixPanel your sender id:

````javascript
mixpanel.initWithToken('YOUR-TOKEN');
mixpanel.initPushHandling('YOUR-SENDER-ID');
```
